        <h2>The problem</h2>
        <h3>Why did we make this toolkit?</h3>
        <p> In many cities and regions there are initiatives in which citizens are encouraged to actively participate
          yet
          scaling up towards the point where this effort can have a significant impact is the most challenging.
          <br><br>
          The limited organizational force of many cooperatives and perceived technological or legal barriers are often
          hurdles to take the next step.
          <br><br>
          Another important factor is that initiatives aimed at (individual) citizens usually attract a certain type of
          citizen: the relatively affluent, intrinsically motivated, and green oriented citizen. To have a significant
          impact on the degree of renewable energy we need to engage with not just the frontrunners, but the masses.

      <h2>Our goal</h2>
      <h3>Change the role of the citizen</h3>
      <p>The project aims to demonstrate and accelerate the empowerment of citizens to become active energy citizens -
        and
        to create local energy communities via existing civil society structures - through development of new
        solutions
        (e.g. organisational) and adoption of new, emerging and existing solutions for energy ownership. This will
        lead to
        an increase of energy awareness and renewable energy production, and hence reduce the environmental footprint
        in
        the North Sea Region.
